# HasMany

Below is how you can define a `HasMany` relationship.

```ts
@Definition()
export class Store {
  @Id()
  id: ObjectId;

  @Property()
  name: string;

  @HasMany(() => Product, {
    to: 'storeId',
    allowCreateWithin: true,
    allowFindAll: true,
    allowPaginate: true,
  })
  products: Product[];
}

@Definition()
export class Product {
  @Id()
  id: ObjectId;

  @Property()
  name: string;

  @Property({ type: () => GraphQLObjectId })
  storeId: ObjectId;
}
```

<Callout>
  `GraphQLObjectId` is a custom scalar that is imported from `'dryerjs'`
</Callout>

In the above example, we have defined a `HasMany` relationship between `Store` and `Product`. This means that a `Store` can have many `Products`.
Because of that we have to define a `storeId` property on the `Product` class. This is the foreign key that will be used to identify which `Store` a `Product` belongs to.

## Create API

```graphql
mutation {
  createStore(input: {
    name: "Awsome Store 1",
    products: [
      { name: "Product 1" }
      { name: "Product 2" }
    ]
  }) {
    id
    name
    products {
      id
      name
    }
    paginateProducts {
      docs {
        id
        name
      }
      totalDocs
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout>
  If you want <b>NOT</b> to allow create products along with store, you can set `allowCreateWithin` to `false` in the options or just omit it.
</Callout>

## Resolve fields

As you can see in the above example, we can get the `products` and `paginateProducts` fields on the `Store` type. You can suppress these fields by setting `allowFindAll` and `allowPaginate` to `false` in the options or just omit them.

## Ensure relationship

By default, you cannot remove a `Store` if it has any `Products`. To allow remove that, you can set `skipRelationCheckOnRemove` to `true` in the options;

## Multi-level support

Create API also supports multi-level relationship. For example, if you define `Product` has many `Variant`, then you can create a `Store` with `Products` and `Variants` in one go. Just like `HasMany`, `BelongsTo`, `HasOne` and `ReferencesMany` also support multi-level relationship.
