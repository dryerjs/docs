# Remove Modes

It is complicated to remove documents with active relations. Sometime you might want to force remove a document, even if it has active relations, by ignoring the relations or by remove the related documents as well.
DryerJS provides some modes to remove documents.

```ts
export enum RemoveMode {
  RequiredCleanRelations = 'RequiredCleanRelations',
  IgnoreRelations = 'IgnoreRelations',
  CleanUpRelationsAfterRemoved = 'CleanUpRelationsAfterRemoved',
}
```

- `RequiredCleanRelations`: This is the default mode. It will throw an error if the document has active relations.
- `IgnoreRelations`: It will remove the document even if it has active relations and leave related documents as they are.
- `CleanUpRelationsAfterRemoved`: It will remove the document and also try to remove the related documents.

By default, only `RequiredCleanRelations` mode is enabled. To enabled other modes, you need to set the `removalConfig` in the `@Definition` decorator.

```ts
@Definition({
  removalConfig: {
    allowIgnoreRelationCheck: true,
    allowCleanUpRelationsAfterRemoved: true,
  },
})
export class Product {}
```
